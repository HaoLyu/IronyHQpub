I build this package to use Brown Cluster built by CMU Tweet NLP group 
http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/#tweeboparser_tweebank
They build a 1000 cluster corpus based on 56,345,753 tweets using Brown Clustering. In order to get the word counts of each cluster when I use the tweets collected by myself, I wrote this package to help this. 

You can use it by defining your own input.txt and get the output, which is a pickle file. Twc.csv is the corpus built by CMU Tweet NLP.
